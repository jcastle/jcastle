### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

- Pronouns: He/Him
- Iâ€™m currently working on updating my new GitHub profile and corresponding repositories. My [previous profile](https://github.com/jcastle-zz) is quite robust and worth a look. 
- Ask me about open source software development and specifically with federal source code and [code.gov](https://code.gov/).
- In 2021, I was part of the inaugural [GitHub Stars](https://stars.github.com/) cohort and completed my [PhD research](https://github.com/jcastle-zz/dissertation_publishingOSS) on implementation of the [Federal Source Code Policy](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2016/08/08/peoples-code) based on publication of the People's Code.
